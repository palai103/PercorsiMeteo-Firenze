# PercorsiMeteo Firenze

This assignment was developed by me and [Federico Tammaro](https://github.com/Sfullez) for Multimedia Design and Production course at Universit√† degli Studi di Firenze, the original project requirements were given by our teachers.

PercorsiMeteo Firenze a web application made to search for points of interest around the user, choose a route between POIs and eventually filter outside places in case of bad weather. As use-case we populated the app database with POIs in Firenze, but it can be easily extended to work in every city, using the Python script we also used to retrieve those POIs.

There's also a pdf report (only Italian avaiable) - [Project Reporting](../master/PercorsiMeteo_report.pdf "Project PDF Report")

**Work in progess for this README**
